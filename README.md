Useless Map
===========

This is a small project with the [new bokeh
version](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.11.0/). It creates a map that
randomly updates the color of each state that isn't Alaska or Hawaii. It isn't a
visualization of anything in particular, just a fun exercise making a map that
changes color over time. [Now if you'll bear with me for a
moment...](https://xkcd.com/365/)
